Recently, Leeson and and Russ [released a paper](http://www.peterleeson.com/Witch_Trials.pdf) describing the relationship between the witch trials of Europe and the competitiveness between the papal and reformation churches of medieval Europe. It's due to be released in [the Economic Journal](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1468-0297) shortly.

The paper is a fascinating quantitative exploration: but the incredible achievement in data collection that under pins it shouldn't be overlooked. Leeson and Russ have developed a database of over 10 000 witch trials in middle ages Europe. [And they put it on Github for everyone](https://github.com/JakeRuss/witch-trials). 

I took a look at the dataset and thought that it provided a golden opportunity to do a little hunt of my own: and to show how some as-yet relatively unknown R packages can help with that.
